            "The Mapuche people is one of the original American ethnicities, with evidence of their settlement in the southern cone of the continent since at least the fifth century BC. Hunter and horticulturist people never had a desire to conquer or built empires, choosing to organize locally and with a predilection for self-sufficiency. In the 15th century a victorious war was waged in response to the Inca Empire's attempt to conquer its territory, although the northernmost parts had to agree to pay a tribute. Shortly after, the arrival of the Spaniards and the conquest of the continent destroyed the Inca Empire. The Europeans also tried to conquer the Mapuche territories, which at that time were inhabited by a million people. Again, the Indians responded with a war of resistance that lasted more than a century. Although European diseases had decimated the indigenous population (there were only 200,000 Mapuches left in 1598), they managed to defeat the Spaniards in the battle of Curalaba.",
            "Over the following centuries, the Spaniards recognized Mapuche independence, agreed to establish the border on the Biob\u00edo River, and avoided entering their territories, which continued under their traditional self-government.",
            "In the nineteenth century, Argentina and Chile, states under construction after achieving independence from Spain, undertook the conquest of the Mapuches, which they achieved through bloody wars. As a result, most of the common lands were stolen by the state and sold to landowners, causing cultural and economic trauma for a people deeply rooted in their physical environment. The struggles to recover these lands continued until today, with occupations and demonstrations being common, often harshly repressed.",
            "The Mapuche social organization is based on the small scale, being the main unit the core family. Several families, linked by kinship, live in nearby houses forming a lof, where the most important jobs are shared. Only in emergencies (war, hunger, disease) did the lofs organize themselves into larger entities, the 'rehues'.",
            "Mapuche religiosity is focused on the relationship between the supernatural and the tangible world, with special concern for honoring nature spirits and ancestors, as well as Mother Earth ('\u00d1uke Mapu'). According to their cosmovision, the world has three planes: the superior ('Wenu Mapu'), where divine beings and Mapuche ancestors live, the terrestrial world ('Nag Mapu'), where people and nature reside, and the underworld ('Mi\u00f1che Mapu'), subterranean, where evil spirits live.",
            "The Mapuches do not know the institutionalization of religion, nor do they construct buildings for their ceremonies, which are generally carried out in nature. In each locality there is a shaman who guides the rites.",

During the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries the Guaranies suffered the conquests of the Portuguese and Spaniards, who enslaved them to use them as labor and confined them in the Jesuit 'reductions' to suppress their way of life and religion. However, thanks to the protection of the immense jungle areas, the Guaran\u00ed culture was preserved. Only at the end of the 19th century did it begin to suffer a major threat, with the promotion of extensive monoculture agriculture, which devastated the jungle and deprived the Guarani of their territory.",

Musicologists, writers and folkorists travelled through the villages tracing oral creations, including the mythological creatures that populated the forests.

            " The Pygmies, along with the San, are considered the oldest inhabitants of Africa, and by extension, the entire world, having appeared on the continent some 70,000 years ago. Although today they live scattered in various remote areas of the rainforest, they are all descended from a common group that began to split up 20,000 years ago as a result of the fragmentation of the forest masses caused by the last ice age. Today they are spread throughout the forests of Gabon, Cameroon, Congo, Central African Republic, DR Congo, and also Haiti, where they were brought as slaves.",
            " The Pygmies engage in artisanal hunting, shooting antelope, monkeys, pigs, and birds with nets, bows, and spears, and gather all kinds of wild fruits and vegetables. They also trade with neighboring peoples of other ethnic groups, from whom they often adopt the language (as there are few traces of the ancient Pygmy language). They move constantly through the forest, constructing light dwellings of branches and leaves. All daily actions are accompanied by sophisticated vocal music.",
            " The Pygmies believe in a supreme god, Komba, although they also worship the spirit of the forest, Jengi, which is a form of manifestation of the deity that would be more accessible for communication with humans.  ",
            " The isolation of the Pygmies is due to their way of life, but also to their bad historical experiences in their relations with other peoples. Both the Bantu people and later European settlers mistreated the Pygmies, even to the point of enslaving them or displaying them in Western zoos. Even today, under the guise of one of the very frequent wars in this part of Africa, they are slaughtered and exploited and even downright enslaved by their neighbors.",

According to some ancient texts, the Catoblepas is evil, but the weight of its head prevents it from doing too much damage; according to others, it keeps its gaze fixed on the ground out of kindness, because it does not want to exert its deadly power. Other authors point out that it is not his gaze that is deadly, but his breath, since he feeds on poisonous herbs.",

Since its appearance is associated with dangers at sea, occasional shipwrecks or accidents that almost lead to shipwrecks, some seafarers believe that it is an evil creature that lures crews to the cliffs to bewitch them and force them to keep it company forever, and that it accomplishes this either with a beguiling song or by imitating other people's cries for help. Other sailors, on the other hand, believe that it is a benign being that warns ships of danger or, in the event of a shipwreck, warns nearby ships to come to their aid. According to this theory, the Maruxaina would be mainly terrestrial, spending her time spinning around and climbing a rock before the sea gets rough to warn sailors not to go out to sea or return to port.",

A few centuries later, the empire disintegrated and two Germanic peoples settled in the Gallaecia region: first the Suebi, who established an independent kingdom, and later the Visigoths, who ruled the entire peninsula until the destruction of their empire by the Islamic invasion. However, the Muslims were unable to subjugate Galicia, which remained independent and unruled until the formation of the first medieval kingdoms.",

            "Kukulkan is often depicted as a serpentine deity adorned with resplendent feathers, his majestic form evoking both awe and reverence. With a long, truncated nose and the ability to traverse water with ease, he commands the elements, wielding blazing torches as he sits upon the cross-shaped tree of the four winds.",
            "His visage, a harmonious blend of serpent and avian features, is adorned with luminous plumage that catches the light with a mesmerizing sheen. His dominion over the natural world is unmistakable, as he exerts his influence through seismic events like earthquakes and earth movements.",
            "Born as a serpentine child and nurtured in the depths of a cave by his sister, Kukulkan's journey from mortal to divine is marked by his profound connection to the earth and its forces. Each year, he signals his continued existence with tremors that reverberate through the land, a testament to his enduring power.",
            "Kukulkan embodies the liminal space between humanity and divinity, symbolizing the intricate dance between the earthly and the celestial realms. His presence heralds renewal and transformation, serving as a bridge between mortal beings and the primordial forces of nature.",
            "According to the prophetic texts of the Chilam Balam, Kukulkan's return signifies the culmination of a sacred epoch, ushering in an era of upheaval and change. As he reemerges from the depths of myth and legend, his appearance coincides with the conclusion of a cosmic cycle in the Mayan calendar, signaling profound shifts in the fabric of existence.",
            "In his return, Kukulkan marks not just the end of an era, but the beginning of a new chapter in Maya cosmology and history, a pivotal moment that shapes the destiny of the universe itself."

            "The Mayan culture began to develop in Central America around 2600 BC, with the formation of the first villages. At that time they already practiced agriculture with Mayan diet foods: corn, beans and pumpkins. Their way of life was a path and they had also mastered pottery.",
            " Although they were traditionally a rural culture, between 250 and 900 AD a network of cities developed, independent of each other, with a high technological and constructive level. This urbanization brought to their culture innumerable discoveries of a scientific and artistic nature, and also caused the division of the population into classes. That society collapsed in the 10th century, possibly due to the exhaustion of natural resources, and the Mayans left the cities to return to the countryside, although new cities and new rulers would push them into constant wars between them.",
            " The Mayan religion is polytheistic and believes in a supernatural world inhabited by powerful deities whose favor must be won through sacrifices and rituals. Ancestors and shamans play an essential role in the relationship with these gods. Although during the most urban periods a caste of priests was formed who codified all the rituals creating a State religion, among the plebeians and peasants their most shamanistic form was maintained, which recovered when the political power collapsed.",
            " The conquest of this small area of America would cost Spain almost two hundred years, until the last city, Nojpetén, was defeated. However, the distribution of the population in areas of very difficult access allowed the Mayas to preserve their culture, language and religion, in spite of the great efforts of the Catholic missionaries to change their customs. The Mayas are today the second largest native ethnic group in Mexico, and have a strong presence in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.",

            "According to Hopi tradition, humanity has passed through three stages, each marked by corruption and a departure from the teachings of the Great Spirit. As a result, humanity has been almost completely annihilated by natural catastrophes, leaving only a few virtuous survivors. In the most recent purification episode, the survivors were guided by a Great Chief who carved Sacred Stone Tablets containing revelations, laws, and prophecies.",
            "The Great Chief had two sons, the Younger Brother and the Elder Brother, named Bahana. The Younger Brother would remain in the lands of the Great Spirit in the East, while Bahana was to travel in search of him. Together, they would bring about the next Day of Purification when this stage of humanity also becomes corrupt. Thus, they would establish true justice and peace on Earth.",
            "Bahana will appear as an all-powerful being, dressed in a Red Cloak, and will belong to no known religion. He will be accompanied by two very powerful beings, identified by solar symbols. His arrival will precede the Day of Purification, during which the Earth will tremble and calamities will ensue. Bahana will then seek the Sacred Stone Tablets to fulfill his mission. If he succeeds and some Hopi remain faithful to the Great Spirit, the Great Spirit will manifest and establish a new era of peace and eternal life."

            "The Hopi Indians, belonging to the Pueblo group, have a rich history that dates back over a thousand years in northeastern Arizona. Sedentary and peaceful, they developed an advanced agricultural culture with irrigation systems and terraces. Despite the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, they managed to preserve much of their cultural heritage.",
            "The life of the Hopi is deeply connected to the land and agriculture, cultivating corn, beans, and squash. Their villages on rocky mesas provide protection and strategic views. The society is matrilineal, with women owning the land and homes, while men handle religious ceremonies and community affairs. A ceremonial calendar dictates agricultural activities and festivities.",
            "Today, the Hopi face significant challenges. Modernity and external influence have changed their way of life, affecting their environment through mining and water and land conservation issues. Additionally, they struggle to preserve their language and ancestral knowledge. The Hopi Reservation, located in northeastern Arizona and surrounded by the Navajo Nation, is the current home of most of the Hopi population. Despite these challenges, they remain resilient, working to maintain their cultural and spiritual identity.",

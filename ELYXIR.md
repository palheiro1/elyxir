## Core Concepts

* **Potions as Items**

  * Single-use items granting **+1 Power** to a creature under specific conditions (e.g., by Medium or Continent).
  * Usable only by the attacking army in this release.
* **Inventory and Marketplace**

  * Potions live in the same wallet as cards; a switch toggles between Card view and Item view.
  * Potions appear on the Marketplace for buying/selling like cards.
* **Bounty and Pack Opening**

  * Bounty rewards can include potions.
  * Every tenth pack may award a potion, as an extra slot or replacing a card.
* **Battlegrounds Integration**

  * Players equip one potion before launching an attack.
  * Deployed potions apply the +1 Power bonus when conditions are met.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Collecting Potions**

   * Rewards from bounty quests or pack openings.
   * Displayed in inventory grid alongside cards.
2. **Trading Potions**

   * ‚ÄúITEMS‚Äù option on Marketplace to list/bid/offers.
   * Market UI mirrors card trading experience.
3. **Using Potions**

   * Item picker on Battlegrounds screen to equip a single potion per battle.
   * Potion consumed at battle end and bonus applied.

# ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

## üß™ Inventory

GAMEPLAY

INTRODUCTION

ELYXIR is a blockchain-based potion-making game set in the universe of the Mythical Beings card game. Collect ingredients, research recipes, and make potions. Master the art of running a potions store or explore the effects of potions on your Battlegrounds army to strengthen your creatures and win the battle.

Making potions in ELYXIR was never meant to be quick and easy. Potions can be a real advantage in battle and should be used wisely.


CRAFTING

Crafting is how players make potions. Crafting takes place in the Laboratory using ingredients, tools and recipes to achieve certain effects.


INGREDIENTS

Ingredients are used and mixed together to create potions. Ingredients can be found/won in Battlegrounds arenas, crafted from Mythical Beings cards or bought from other players on the marketplace. There will be other apps and games where certain ingredients can be collected.

There are currently 4 types of ingredients: herbs, mushrooms, flowers and shards.


TOOLS

Tools are required to create the potions. All tools can only be gathered in the Mythical Beings Jackpot as a reward, similar to the special cards in Season 1 and 2.

There are currently 4 tools:
    • Bellows: to heat up the potion
    • Cauldron: used to mix the ingredients
    • Mortar: grind up the ingredients and bring out their full potential
    • Ladle: bring the potion back in the flask


FLASKS

Flasks are needed for filling the potions. The better quality and size the flasks are, the more creatures are affected by the potions effects. There is a chance that empty flasks might be destroyed after usage.

There are currently 5 flasks:
    • Conical flask: 1 portion
    • Pear-Shaped Flask: 2 potions
    • Kjeldahl Flask: 3 potions
    • Florence Flask: 4 potions
    • Round-Bottom Flask: 5 potions


RECIPES

Recipes need to be learned. When you come across a new recipe, you add it to your recipes known. The recipes specify which ingredients and tools are needed to make a potion (incl. costs).

There are 3 types of recipes and a total of over 50 known country specific recipes:
    • Common recipes: potion costs X GEM and duration X BLOCKS to create
    • Uncommon recipes: potion costs 3X GEM  and duration 3X BLOCKS  to create
    • Rare recipes: potion costs 6X GEM  and duration 6X BLOCKS  to create


EFFECTS

Effects of potions have a direct impact on creatures in battle. Effects last only as long as the battle. Effects can be combined within a potion. Certain effects only affect creatures that can absorb those effects.

Examples of Effects (List will be continued):
    • +X Strengths for the own creature
    • -X Strength for the opponent's creature
    • Double the dice roll for one creature one time
    • Creature that would lose the 1v1 instead wins
    • Creature that would lose the 1v1 has a draw
    • Duplicate that creature
    • ….


MARKETPLACE

Marketplace is needed for trade. All items or ingredients needed for Elyxir can be bought or sold on the decentralized market.

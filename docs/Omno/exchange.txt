accept(id:longUnsignedString, multiplier:longUnsignedString)
cancel(id:longUnsignedString)
offer(take:tokenObject, give:tokenObject, multiplier:longUnsignedString)

The exchange implements a mechanism to trade one or more assets for other assets that may include a combination of
 chain tokens (such as IGNIS, BITS, GPS, ARDR etc.), assets such as Tarasca Cards and also native assets that may
 have a royalty feature.

Offers consists of a give object, a take object and a multiplier. The operation will place an offer on the exchange with
 a unique id that identifies the offer. A match is made by specifying the id and how many matches to accept which decreases
 the "multiplier".

{
  "contract": "ContractName",

  "operation":
  [
      {
          "service": "trade",
          "request": "offer",

          "parameter":
          {
              "give":{"chain": {"2": "100000000", "1": "200000000"}, "asset": {"1234567890":  "3"}},
              "take":{"chain": {"4": "10000000000"}},
              "multiplier":"10"
          }
      }
   ]
}

Example of accept a trade with id "1". The multiplier of "3" will take x3 and give x3 the corresponding
 offer tokenObject values and the balances of both accounts updated.

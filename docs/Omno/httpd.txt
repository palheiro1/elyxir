The HTTP REST API server is configured in the "api" configuration.json object. This initial release only employs a simple
"password" field. Presently the API is read-only and does not contain secrets.

The address will be something like "localhost:port/api"

The GET parameters are passed a JSON object which will need to be URL-encoded.

localhost:port/api?{"password":"password","service":"user","request":"state"}
localhost:port/api?%7B%22password%22%3A%22password%22%2C%22service%22%3A%22user%22%2C%22request%22%3A%22state%22%7D

The trade state contains the available offers. The user state contains the user's balances. The nativeAsset state
 contains the native asset definitions.

Shortform of commands

"service":"user" state()
"service":"trade" state()
"service":"nativeAsset" state()
"service":"platformSwap" state()
